# FINAL PROJECT IRWA: TWEETS BASED SEARCH ENGINE

This project aims to build a search engine implementing different indexing and ranking
algorithms. This will be done using a file containing a set of tweets from the World Health
Organization (@WHO).

It will be divided in four parts:
  1) Text processing
  2) Indexing and ranking
  3) Evaluation 
  4) User Interface and Web analytics

### SETUP Notes
Installation of 'nltk' and 'regex' module is needed. 

## 1) TEXT PROCESSING

In the first part of the project, it has pre-processed the document. To do so it have been removed stop-words and
punctuation and tokenization and stemming has been performed. 

For example, from this text:
